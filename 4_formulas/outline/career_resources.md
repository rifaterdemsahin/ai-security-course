## 2. Building Your Job-Ready Portfolio: Show, Don't Just Tell

Your work in the hands-on labs and the final project is the cornerstone of your portfolio. Here's how to build upon it to create a compelling demonstration of your expertise:

### Document Your Course Projects

**Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository**
```
your-username/ai-security-portfolio
├── module-1-evasion-attack/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── attack_report.json
│   ├── evasion_attack.ipynb
│   └── results/
├── module-2-adversarial-training/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── defense_report.json
│   ├── adversarial_training.ipynb
│   └── results/
├── module-3-red-team-audit/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── red_team_audit.json
│   ├── security_audit.ipynb
│   └── results/
└── final-project/
    ├── README.md
    ├── security_audit_report.json
    ├── final_audit.ipynb
    └── results/
```

**Step 2: Write Compelling README Files**

Use the "punchline" format from the course:

```markdown
# Module 1: Evading an AI Security Camera

## The Challenge
Test the resilience of a 99.8% accurate security model against adversarial patches.

## The Approach
Applied an adversarial patch to authorized personnel images and measured
the model's misclassification rate.

## The Result
Successfully fooled the model in 87% of cases, demonstrating that high
test accuracy does not guarantee adversarial robustness.

## Key Findings
- Original prediction confidence: 99.2%
- Attack prediction confidence: 97.6%
- Attack success rate: 87%

## Skills Demonstrated
- Adversarial attack execution
- Model vulnerability assessment
- Security testing methodology
```

### Replicate a Published Attack

**Why:** Demonstrates deep technical capability and research literacy

**How:**
1. Find a well-known paper (e.g., Carlini & Wagner attack, DeepFool)
2. Implement the attack on a public model and dataset
3. Compare your results with the paper's findings
4. Document any differences or insights

**Example Project:**
```markdown
# Replicating "Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Neural Networks"

Implemented the C&W L2 attack on a ResNet-50 model trained on ImageNet.

**Results:**
- Successfully replicated the paper's attack success rate (>95%)
- Average perturbation L2 norm: 2.34 (paper: 2.41)
- Discovered that attack effectiveness varies significantly by object category

**Code:** [github.com/yourname/cw-attack-replication]
```

### Analyze Real-World AI Security Incidents

**Why:** Shows you stay current and can apply knowledge to novel situations

**When:** After a real-world AI security incident occurs (e.g., LLM jailbreak, vision model bypass)

**How:**
1. Research the incident thoroughly
2. Write a blog post or LinkedIn article
3. Explain the likely vulnerability
4. Propose defensive strategies based on course learning

**Example Topics:**
- "How the ChatGPT Jailbreak Works: An Analysis"
- "Lessons from the Clearview AI Scraping Controversy"
- "Breaking Down the LLaMA Model Extraction Attack"

---

### Build a Security Testing Tool

**Example Project Ideas:**

**1. Adversarial Example Generator**
```python
# A library for quickly generating adversarial examples
# with multiple attack methods (FGSM, PGD, C&W)

from adversarial_toolkit import AttackSuite

suite = AttackSuite(model, dataset)
results = suite.run_all_attacks()
suite.generate_report()
```

**2. Model Robustness Benchmarking Tool**
```python
# Automated tool to test a model against a suite of attacks
# and generate a security scorecard

from ml_security_scanner import Scanner

scanner = Scanner(your_model)
scorecard = scanner.run_security_audit()
print(f"Robustness Score: {scorecard.overall_score}/100")
```
