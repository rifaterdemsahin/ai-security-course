### 5. AI-Graded Hands-On Lab: Red Teaming the Fortified Model
**Format:** Practice Assignment  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Aligned LO:** LO3

#### Scenario
You are now a lead analyst on the SynthSafe AI Red Team. The `v2_resilient_model` you helped the Blue Team develop in Module 2 has been deployed. It successfully defends against the original adversarial patch attack, and management considers the case closed.

However, your Red Team operates under the principle of "Trust, but Verify." You know that defenses are often specific; hardening a model against one type of attack can leave it exposed to others.

**Your Mission:** Conduct a professional security audit on the `v2_resilient_model`. You won't be using just one attack; you will run a suite of different, more advanced adversarial attacks to systematically probe for new weaknesses.

**Goal:** Measure model resilience, identify which attack methods are most effective, and provide a quantitative report on its breaking points. This is the essence of the AI Security Lifecycle: continuously validating your defenses against an evolving threat landscape.

#### Lab Instructions

**Step 1: Load the System Under Test**
- Load the `v2_resilient_model`
- Load a clean `evaluation_dataset` containing 100 labeled images of personnel
- Verify all necessary libraries are imported

**Step 2: Establish Baseline Accuracy**
- Before launching any attacks, measure the model's performance on legitimate data
- Calculate and record the accuracy of `v2_resilient_model` on the clean `evaluation_dataset`
- This is your benchmark for a "no-attack" scenario

**Step 3: Execute the Red Team Attack Suite**
You will be provided with three different attack functions:
- `generate_fgsm_attack()` - Fast Gradient Sign Method
- `generate_pgd_attack()` - Projected Gradient Descent
- `generate_noise_attack()` - Random noise injection

For each of the three attack types:
1. Use the function to create a new set of adversarial images based on the clean `evaluation_dataset`
2. Test the `v2_resilient_model` against this new adversarial dataset
3. Calculate and record the model's accuracy under that specific attack
4. You should expect the accuracy to drop for each one

**Step 4: Analyze the Audit Results**
- Compare the accuracy scores from the three attacks
- Identify which attack was the most effective (caused the lowest accuracy)
- This represents the model's biggest current vulnerability
- Consider why this attack was most successful

**Step 5: Compile the Security Audit Report**
- Based on your findings, generate the deliverable JSON file
- Include all required metrics

#### Deliverables

Submit a single file named `red_team_audit.json`:

```json
{
  "baseline_accuracy": 0.98,
  "most_effective_attack": "pgd_attack",
  "lowest_accuracy_score": 0.42
}
```

**Required Keys:**
- `baseline_accuracy`: Model's accuracy (float 0.0-1.0) on clean, non-adversarial evaluation dataset
- `most_effective_attack`: Name of the attack (string) that resulted in the lowest accuracy score
  - Valid values: `"fgsm_attack"`, `"pgd_attack"`, or `"noise_attack"`
- `lowest_accuracy_score`: Model's accuracy (float 0.0-1.0) when tested against the most effective attack

#### Learning Outcomes
This hands-on lab effectively simulates a real-world AI security audit. It requires you to apply a systematic testing methodology, interpret the results to find specific weaknesses, and quantify the model's security posture, bringing the entire AI Security Lifecycle full circle.

**Key Insight:** Even a model that was hardened against one specific attack may still be vulnerable to other attack types. Comprehensive security requires continuous testing against diverse threats.

1. **Testing is Mandatory**: A defense that isn't tested is a defense you can't trust
2. **Diversity Matters**: Test against multiple attack types—hardening against one doesn't guarantee protection against others
3. **Continuous Process**: Security is a lifecycle, not a one-time implementation
4. **Quantify Everything**: Use metrics to measure resilience objectively
5. **Fail Forward**: Every vulnerability discovered is an opportunity to strengthen your system
6. **Red Team + Blue Team**: Adversarial testing creates a feedback loop that drives continuous improvement

## Attack Type Comparison

| Attack Type | Sophistication | Detection Difficulty | Typical Success Rate |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| FGSM | Low | Medium | Moderate |
| PGD | High | High | High |
| Random Noise | Very Low | Low | Low |
| Patch Attack | Medium | Medium | Moderate-High |

**Key Learning:** More sophisticated attacks (like PGD) are harder to defend against and require more robust hardening techniques.
