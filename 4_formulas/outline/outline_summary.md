# Secure AI: Interpret and Protect Models

## Course Overview

**Duration:** 70 minutes  
**Level:** Intermediate  
**Lead Instructor:** Rifat Erdem Sahin

## Main Outcome

After completing this course, learners will be able to analyze a complex AI model for security vulnerabilities, implement robust defenses, and evaluate their effectiveness against sophisticated adversarial threats.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

**LO1:** Analyze and identify a range of security vulnerabilities in complex AI models, including evasion, data poisoning, and model extraction attacks.

**LO2:** Apply defense mechanisms like adversarial training and differential privacy to protect AI systems from known threats.

**LO3:** Evaluate the effectiveness of security measures by designing and executing simulated adversarial attacks to test the resilience of defended AI model.

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI systems are not infallible black boxes** - They are software with unique vulnerabilities. Learn to see models through the eyes of an attacker, recognizing how they can be manipulated through evasion, data poisoning, and model extraction attacks.

2. **Effective AI security is a proactive design choice** - Not an afterthought. Grasp how to implement and configure robust defenses like adversarial training, input sanitization, and differential privacy directly into the model's lifecycle to harden it from the ground up.

3. **A defense is only as good as its ability to withstand an attack** - Master the skill of adversarial testing and "Red Teaming" for AIâ€”designing and executing simulated attacks to empirically measure your model's resilience and prove that its security measures actually work under pressure.

4. **Protecting an AI system is an ongoing process** - Internalize the complete security lifecycle: a continuous loop of diagnosing new threats, implementing appropriate defenses, and validating the system's strength to stay ahead of evolving adversarial tactics.

## Real-World Connections

### Stop Sign Attacks on Self-Driving Cars
Researchers have demonstrated how placing simple stickers on a stop sign can trick a self-driving car's image recognition system into misclassifying it as a speed limit sign. This highlights a classic evasion attack, where a minor, malicious input change causes a catastrophic model failure in the real world.

### Apple's Differential Privacy
Apple uses differential privacy in its iOS keyboard to gather data and improve predictive text suggestions without accessing the specific content of what users are typing. This proactive privacy-preserving technique is a core example of building security into a model's data pipeline from the start.

### Microsoft and Google's AI Red Teams
Major tech companies employ AI "Red Teams" whose sole job is to attack their own systems, such as trying to fool a new facial recognition model or bypass a content moderation filter. This adversarial testing is critical for discovering vulnerabilities before product release.

### Email Spam Filter Arms Race
Email spam filters are in a constant arms race with attackers who continuously devise new phrasing and tactics to bypass them. This perfectly illustrates the ongoing cycle of threat analysis, defense implementation, and validation.

## Course Description

Ever wonder if your smart AI is actually secure? In this course, we'll ditch the dry theory to show you how to build genuinely resilient AI systems from the ground up, making security a core part of your design, not just an afterthought. You'll begin by stepping into the role of an AI Security Architect, running a "pre-mortem" to think like an attacker and neutralize threats before they even happen. Through focused videos and exercises, you'll master essential defenses like blocking bad data with input sanitization, 'vaccinating' your model against attacks with adversarial training, and protecting user data with differential privacy. This all culminates in a hands-on lab where you'll personally fix a vulnerable model and prove its new resilience. The main goal is to shift your mindset from reactive patching to proactive design, so you'll walk away with the real-world skills to analyze defense strategies, successfully harden a model in a lab, and design a comprehensive security plan for any new AI project.
