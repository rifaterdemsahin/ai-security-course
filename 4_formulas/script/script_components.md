### **Document Format & Structural Schema**

The document follows a highly structured, hierarchical format, broken down into lessons, which are composed of videos, which themselves contain specific, repeatable segments.

**1. COURSE LEVEL**
```json
{
  "course": {
    "title": "Secure AI: Interpret and Protect Models",
    "status": "Writing complete > Done | AI rules fix > Done | Outline comparison > Done | Submission > Done",
    "components": [
      "Intro Video Script",
      "Lessons",
      "Outro Script",
      "Promo Script"
    ]
  }
}
```

**2. SEGMENT-LEVEL FORMAT (Applied to Intro, Videos, Outro, Promo)**
Each video/segment uses a consistent template with specific fields.

      "explanation": "Why the correct answer is right.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Brief rationale for each incorrect option."
    }
  }
}
```

**3. LESSON LEVEL**
Lessons are containers for videos and assessments.
```json
{
  "lesson": {
    "identifier": "📝 Lesson 1: [Lesson Title]",
    "videos": [
      { "video_segment": "... (Video 1 data) ..." },
      { "video_segment": "... (Video 2 data) ..." }
    ],
    "hands_on_learning_transition": {
      "narrative": "A story-driven prompt that sets up a lab activity, placing the learner in a real-world scenario.",
      "instructor_tip": "A personal recommendation on how to approach the lab ('If I were doing this...')."
    },
    "graded_questions": [
      {
        "question": "...",
        "correct_answer": "...",
        "explanation": "...",
        "why_others_wrong": "..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**4. COURSE WRAP-UP LEVEL**

### **Key Stylistic & Instructional Conventions**

*   **Emoji Use:** Used as consistent, scannable icons for document sections (📜 for script, 📹 for video, 📝 for lesson/quiz).
*   **Narrative Style:** Highly personal and anecdotal, leveraging the instructor's (Rifat's) experience to build credibility and relatability.
*   **AI Integration:** AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) are explicitly written into the script as part of the modern development workflow.
*   **Assessment Integration:** Formative assessment (In-Video Questions) and summative assessment (Graded Questions) are embedded throughout, with detailed feedback.
*   **Hands-On Focus:** The structure consistently moves from theory -> demonstration -> hands-on lab, emphasizing practical application.
*   **Recurring Analogies:** Uses consistent metaphors like "technical debt as a financial debt" or "infrastructure as a building foundation" to aid understanding.
