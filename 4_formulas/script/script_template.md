Course Title: [Insert the official course title exactly as it appears on the platform]


Notes for the SME:

1. Template Overview: This template is divided into four sections: the Course Intro Video Script, the Modules’ Scripts, the Outro Video Script, and the Promo Video Script.

2. Use the Template: Please follow the template exactly so we can avoid extra back-and-forth during reviews.

3. Word Count: Each Module video script should be between 750 and 1050 words. The intro and outro script must be 450 words. Promo scripts should be ranging between 250 and 300 words.

4. Final Script: Once the script is approved by our team, you can’t make changes when recording. Write it in a way that feels natural and comfortable for you to read out loud.

5. Screenshare Parts: Mark clearly where the screenshare begins and ends by writing <<Screen Share Starts>> and <<Screen Share Ends>>. For these sections, just use simple bullet points to show the concepts on screen—no detailed script is needed. Each video should be 8–10 minutes long and must not go over 10 minutes.

6. Transitional Lines: Adding transitional lines is MANDATORY to create a story-like flow. For example, add a transition before you ask a question (IVQ) or introduce the HOL etc. The transition lines to IVQs can be placed anywhere during the content explanation. They don’t have to come only at the end after the summary.

7. In-Video Question (IVQ): Don’t make all IVQs the same type. Use a mix of recall questions, application-level questions, and scenario-based questions.
