## What Is GitHub Codespaces

Before diving into setup, it helps to understand what Codespaces are and how they work.

* A **codespace** is a cloud-hosted developer environment tied to a GitHub repository. Under the hood it’s a container (via a dev container) running on a virtual machine. ([support.cmts.jhu.edu][1])
* Because the environment is defined declaratively (via config files), everyone working on the project can get a consistent dev setup without needing local installs. ([GitHub Docs][2])
* You can connect via the browser (VS Code in-browser) or your local VS Code (or other supported editors) using Codespaces extensions. ([Visual Studio Code][3])
* Codespaces have a lifecycle: you create, stop (when idle), rebuild, and delete. To manage cost, unused spaces get timed out. ([DataCamp][4])
* There are quotas, billing, and organization-level settings around Codespaces usage. ([support.cmts.jhu.edu][1])

## Prerequisites / Checklist

Before setting up, make sure:

1. **GitHub account & permissions**
   You need a GitHub account with Codespaces enabled. If you're in an organization, the org settings may need to permit Codespaces. ([GitHub Docs][5])

2. **Repository (existing or new)**
   You either have a project you want to run in Codespaces or are starting fresh.

3. **Dev container / configuration files**
   To fully leverage Codespaces, your repo should include a `.devcontainer/` folder (with `devcontainer.json`, optionally a `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`). We'll cover these in detail. ([GitHub Docs][2])

4. **Familiarity with Docker / containers** (helpful but not mandatory)
   Understanding how containers work helps in debugging environment issues.

5. **GitHub CLI or VS Code extension (optional but useful)**
   These let you manage codespaces from your local environment. ([GitHub Docs][6])

## Step 1: Add Dev Container Configuration

If your repo doesn’t yet have a dev container setup, that’s your first task. The dev container config defines what tools, extensions, environment variables, setups, etc. are available in your codespace.

### Typical files

* `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` — main configuration file
* `Dockerfile` (or `docker` folder) — if you need a custom container image
* `docker-compose.yml` (optional) — for multi-service setups (e.g. backend + database)
* Support scripts, `.env`, etc.

### Basic `devcontainer.json` example

```json
{
  "name": "My Project Dev Container",
  "dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
  "context": "..",
  "settings": {
    "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
  },
  "extensions": [
    "ms-python.python",
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  ],
  "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt",
  "forwardPorts": [8000],
  "remoteUser": "vscode"
}
```

You can also use community templates (when VS Code or GitHub offers templates to pick from). ([GitHub Docs][2])

### Things to configure / options

* **Machine spec / minimum cores / RAM** — you can nominate minimal machine size for Codespaces. ([GitHub Docs][2])
* **Features** — e.g. “docker-in-docker”, “gitHub CLI”, or language-specific utilities. ([GitHub Docs][2])
* **Prebuilds** — setting up your codespace ahead of time so startup is faster. ([GitHub Docs][5])

Once you add or update these files, commit them to your repository.

---

## Step 2: Create a Codespace

You can create a codespace in several ways:

* Via GitHub UI: Go to your repo → **Code** → **Codespaces** tab → **Create codespace** (choose branch) ([GitHub Docs][7])
* Via GitHub CLI: `gh codespace create --repo owner/repo --branch <branch>` (if you have the CLI plugin) ([GitHub Docs][6])
* Via VS Code: Use the Codespaces extension to pick a repository/branch and spin up a codespace ([Visual Studio Code][3])

It may take some time initially as the container builds, installs dependencies, etc.

Once it's ready, you'll be connected to a VS Code instance (in-browser or local) with your development environment.

---

## Step 3: Run the Application & Use Forwarded Ports

Inside your codespace:

1. Open a terminal (from VS Code).
2. Run your usual start / dev command (for example `npm run dev`, `python manage.py runserver`, etc.). ([GitHub Docs][7])
3. Codespaces will detect the port your app is running on and offer a forwarded URL (“Open in Browser”). ([GitHub Docs][7])
4. You can also manage ports manually via the **Ports** tab in VS Code. ([GitHub Docs][5])

In forums, users mention:

> “GitHub Codespaces should automatically detect the appropriate ports and open them by default … It then gives you a URL …”
> “You are also easily able to add port’s manually by pressing the blue add port button.” ([Reddit][8])

If you need advanced forwarding (or the built-in doesn’t suffice), you can use alternatives like ngrok, though that’s usually overkill.

---

## Step 4: Use Source Control & Push Changes

Your codespace is a full Git repo. Use VS Code's built-in Source Control view or terminal:

* Stage changes
* Commit with messages
* Push to branches (or publish branch) ([GitHub Docs][7])
* From the “Publish Branch” button, create a new repo or push to an existing one

If collaborators open that branch as a codespace, they’ll get the same dev environment.

---

## Step 5: Connect via Local VS Code (Optional / Recommended)

Instead of working in-browser, you can connect from your local VS Code:

1. Install the GitHub Codespaces extension in VS Code. ([Visual Studio Code][3])
2. From the extension side panel, you can list and open your codespaces.
3. The environment runs remotely, but you get the local editor UX.

This gives you benefits like local keybindings, local file search, etc.

---

## Step 6: Manage Lifecycle — Stop, Rebuild, Delete

To optimize cost, manage your codespace lifecycle:

* **Stop (shutdown):** when idle, so CPU billing stops (you’re only charged for storage) ([DataCamp][4])
* **Rebuild:** if you change `devcontainer.json` or container configs, you can rebuild the container (without losing files in `/workspaces`) ([DataCamp][4])
* **Delete / Retention:** you can delete codespaces you no longer need. Inactive ones may auto-delete after a configured retention period (max 30 days) ([DataCamp][4])

---

## Tips, Pitfalls, & Best Practices

* **Start simple** — get a basic devcontainer working before adding complexity (e.g. databases, multi-service).
* **Use prebuilds** if your repo is used by many developers — speeds up startup. ([GitHub Docs][5])
* **Pin versions** (Python, Node, etc.) in your container so devs don’t drift.
* **Avoid heavy GPU / resource requirements** unless necessary — Codespaces compute is limited.
* **Secrets / environment variables:** use GitHub secrets or `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`’s `remoteEnv` or `remoteUser` features securely.
* **Test rebuilds** after container config changes.
* **Monitor usage / billing** — especially in organizations; decide whether codespaces are billed to users or to the org. ([support.cmts.jhu.edu][1])
* **Configure timeouts / auto-delete** so stale environments don’t cost you.
* **Keep your devcontainer config in sync** with project needs — update when dependencies change.
