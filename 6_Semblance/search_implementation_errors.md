# Search Implementation Errors and Resolution

This document outlines the errors encountered during the implementation of the search functionality and the steps taken to resolve them.

## 1. Errors Encountered

Three main errors were reported from the browser's console:

### 1.1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Error

- **Error Message:** `Refused to load the script 'blob:https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/...' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive...`
- **Analysis:** This error was identified as likely being caused by a browser extension, as indicated by the `chrome-extension://` protocol in the error message. It was not directly related to the application's code.

### 1.2. TypeError in `escapeHtml`

- **Error Message:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')`
- **Analysis:** This error occurred in the `escapeHtml` function in `search.js`. It was caused by passing an `undefined` value to the function, which then tried to call the `.replace()` method on it. This happened because some of the search result objects did not have all the properties that the `displayResults` function was trying to render.

### 1.3. ReferenceError for `searchResultsContainer`

- **Error Message:** `ReferenceError: searchResultsContainer is not defined`
- **Analysis:** This error occurred because the JavaScript code was trying to access an HTML element with the ID `search-results-content` which did not exist in the `index.html` file.

## 2. Resolution Steps

### 2.1. CSP Error

- **Action:** The user was informed that this error is likely caused by a browser extension and is not a critical issue for the application itself.

### 2.2. `TypeError` in `escapeHtml`

- **Action:** The `escapeHtml` function in `search.js` was made safer by adding a check to handle non-string inputs. If the input is not a string, the function now returns an empty string.

```javascript
function escapeHtml(unsafe) {
    if (typeof unsafe !== 'string') {
        return '';
    }
    return unsafe
        .replace(/&/g, "&amp;")
        .replace(/</g, "&lt;")
        .replace(/>/g, "&gt;")
        .replace(/"/g, "&quot;")
        .replace(/'/g, "&#039;");
}
```

### 2.3. `ReferenceError` and `search.json` Mismatch

- **Action:**
    1.  A new `search.json` file was created in the `5_Symbols` directory with a comprehensive structure that the new `search.js` expects. This new structure includes various content types like `modules`, `lessons`, `technical_terms`, etc.
    2.  The `index.html` file was updated to include a `<div id="search-results-content"></div>` inside the main `<div id="search-results"></div>`. This ensures that the JavaScript code can find the container to display the search results.
