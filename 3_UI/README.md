# 3_UI: User Interface

This directory contains documentation related to the user interface of the AI Security Course website.

## Expected UI Components

The course website will be a simple, clean, and modern interface to present the course material. Here are the expected components:

*   **Course Homepage:** A landing page with the course title, a brief description, and a list of modules.
*   **Module Pages:** Each module will have its own page, listing the learning items within that module (videos, readings, labs).
*   **Learning Item Pages:** Each learning item will have its own page.
    *   **Video Pages:** An embedded video player with a transcript.
    *   **Reading Pages:** Formatted text content.
    *   **Lab Pages:** Instructions for the hands-on labs, with links to the Jupyter notebooks or Google Colab.
*   **Navigation:** A clear navigation bar to move between modules and the homepage.
*   **Progress Tracking:** (Optional) A visual indicator to show learners which items they have completed.

The visual style should be professional, clean, and engaging. We will use a modern tech aesthetic.
