# 3_UI: User Interface

This directory contains documentation related to the user interface of the AI Security Course.

## Main Outcome

After completing this course, learners will be able to analyze a complex AI model for security vulnerabilities, implement robust defenses, and evaluate their effectiveness against sophisticated adversarial threats.

### Course Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

*   **LO1:** Analyze and identify a range of security vulnerabilities in complex AI models, including evasion, data poisoning, and model extraction attacks.
*   **LO2:** Apply defense mechanisms like adversarial training and differential privacy to protect AI systems from known threats.
*   **LO3:** Evaluate the effectiveness of security measures by designing and executing simulated adversarial attacks to test the resilience of defended AI model.

15. **Adversarial training vs normal training** - A comparative visual.
16. **Differential privacy in machine learning** - For infographics explaining the concept of "noise."
17. **Differential privacy graph** - To find charts showing the privacy/accuracy trade-off.
18. **AI model robustness techniques** - A broader search for all defense types.
19. **Model hardening security** - Another term for making models more robust.
20. **Federated learning security** - A distributed training method with its own security considerations.

### Category 4: Testing & Evaluation (Related to LO3)
*(These are for finding visuals related to testing, red teaming, and evaluation.)*

21. **AI Red Teaming framework** - For visuals on structured security testing.
22. **Penetration testing AI systems** - For a more hands-on, technical view.
23. **Adversarial example generation** - To see the process of creating attack inputs.
24. **AI model robustness evaluation** - For charts and metrics on measuring security.
25. **Security vs Accuracy tradeoff graph** - A key concept in evaluating defenses.
26. **AI incident response** - For visuals on what to do when an attack is discovered.

### Category 5: Combining Concepts for Precision
*(Mixing terms from different categories will yield the most specific and relevant results.)*

27. **"Adversarial training" defense "evasion attack"** - Connects a specific defense to a specific attack.
28. **"Differential privacy" protects "data poisoning"** - Shows the relationship between two concepts.
29. **Detecting "model extraction" attacks** - Focuses on the identification side of a threat.
30. **"AI Security" dashboard metrics** - For what monitoring a secure AI system might look like.
31. **"Robustness" evaluation "adversarial examples"** - Combines the testing goal with the method.
32. **"Machine Learning" "threat model" "STRIDE"** - Uses a popular security framework (STRIDE) in the context of AI.

### Category 6: Real-World & Metaphorical Searches
*(These can help find more accessible or memorable images.)*

33. **AI Security shield icon** - For symbolic representations of defense.
34. **Hacker attacking AI brain** - A metaphorical search.
35. **Poisoned data barrel** - A visual metaphor for data poisoning.
36. **Lock icon on neural network** - For symbols of security and protection.

**Pro Tip:** When you find a useful image, click on it and visit the source website. Often, the surrounding article or paper will provide even more context and terminology for further, deeper searches.



These search terms will provide visual examples of clean layouts, good typography, and effective use of color in the context of educational and technical content.
