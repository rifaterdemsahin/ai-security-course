- All are pedagogically meaningful

✅ **Coverage**: One IVQ per video (10 total)

---

## SCREEN SHARE SECTION COMPLIANCE

✅ **Screen Share Markers Used Consistently**:
- All demonstration sections marked with:
  - `<<Screen Share Starts>>`
  - Content with bullet points (not detailed script)
  - `<<Screen Share Ends>>`

✅ **Format**: Clean bullet points instead of full narration

✅ **Content Includes**:
- Code examples (clearly marked)
- Concept walkthroughs
- Real-world scenarios
- Visual descriptions

---

## TRANSITION LINE COMPLIANCE

✅ **Mandatory Transitions Present**:
- [x] Transition to IVQ: "Now I have a question for you..."

- Apply: "Implement," "Design"
- Evaluate: "Make decisions," "Compare"

✅ **LO Alignment**:
- **LO1** (Identify vulnerabilities): Videos 1-3 (Module 1)
- **LO2** (Apply defenses): Videos 4-6 (Module 2)
- **LO3** (Evaluate effectiveness): Videos 7-9 (Module 3)
