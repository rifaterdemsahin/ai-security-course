### Main Outcome

After completing this course, learners will be able to analyze a complex AI model for security vulnerabilities, implement robust defenses, and evaluate their effectiveness against sophisticated adversarial threats.

### Course Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

*   **LO1:** Analyze and identify a range of security vulnerabilities in complex AI models, including evasion, data poisoning, and model extraction attacks.
*   **LO2:** Apply defense mechanisms like adversarial training and differential privacy to protect AI systems from known threats.
*   **LO3:** Evaluate the effectiveness of security measures by designing and executing simulated adversarial attacks to test the resilience of defended AI model.
