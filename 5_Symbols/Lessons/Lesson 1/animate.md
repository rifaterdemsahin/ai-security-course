Of course. Here is a clear to-do list to create your animation in Canva.
Project: Animating a Data Poisoning Attack
Phase 1: Planning & Setup (5-10 minutes)
 * [ ] Define the Story: Confirm your key scenes:
   * Title
   * Clean Data
   * Healthy Model
   * The Attack (Poisoning)
   * Corrupted Model
   * Side-by-Side Impact
   * Conclusion
 * [ ] Create a New Project: Log into Canva and create a new project using the Video template.
Phase 2: Building the Scenes (15-20 minutes)
 * [ ] Scene 1: Title Screen
   * Add a text box for the main title (e.g., "Visualizing a Data Poisoning Attack").
   * Add a smaller text box for a subtitle.
 * [ ] Scene 2: The Clean Dataset
   * From the "Elements" tab, add two sets of colored circles (e.g., 10 blue, 10 orange).
   * Arrange them into two distinct clusters on opposite sides of the screen.
   * Add text: "1. Start with a clean dataset."
 * [ ] Scene 3: The Healthy Model
   * Duplicate the previous scene.
   * Add a "brain" or "robot" icon from "Elements."
   * Add a "Line" element that cleanly separates the two color clusters. This is your decision boundary.
   * Change text to: "2. Train a healthy model to classify the data."
 * [ ] Scene 4: The Poisoning Attack
   * Duplicate the previous scene.
   * Add a "hacker" or "warning" icon.
   * Move 2-3 blue circles into the middle of the orange cluster (keep them blue!).
   * Change text to: "3. An attacker poisons the data by mislabeling a few points."
 * [ ] Scene 5: The Corrupted Model
   * Duplicate the previous scene.
   * Delete the "hacker" icon.
   * Move the decision boundary line so it is now skewed and incorrectly classifies some dots.
   * Change text to: "4. The model is retrained on the corrupted data."
 * [ ] Scene 6: The Impact
   * Create a new blank scene.
   * Use a line to split the screen vertically.
   * On the left, add text "Healthy Model" and paste in the elements from Scene 3.
   * On the right, add text "Poisoned Model" and paste in the elements from Scene 5.
 * [ ] Scene 7: Conclusion
   * Add a final text box: "A few bad data points can break an entire AI system."
Phase 3: Animation & Timing (10-15 minutes)
 * [ ] Animate Elements:
   * Go through each scene, click on an element (text, shape, icon), and select the "Animate" button.
   * Use simple animations like "Rise," "Fade," or "Wipe" for a clean look. Use "Typewriter" for text.
 * [ ] Set Scene Duration:
   * In the timeline at the bottom, click on a scene to view its duration (e.g., "5.0s").
   * Adjust the timing for each scene so the text is easily readable (3-5 seconds is usually good).
 * [ ] Add Transitions:
   * Click the "+" icon between each scene in the timeline.
   * Select "Add transition" and choose a simple one like "Dissolve" or "Slide."
Phase 4: Final Polish & Export (5 minutes)
 * [ ] Add Background Music:
   * Go to the "Audio" tab and find a neutral, tech-focused music track.
   * Drag the track onto your video timeline.
 * [ ] Preview:
   * Click the Play button at the top to watch your full animation. Check for any timing or visual errors.
 * [ ] Export:
   * Click "Share" in the top-right corner.
   * Click "Download."
   * Select the File type as "MP4 Video."
   * Click the "Download" button to get your final video file.
